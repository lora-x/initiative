I am a drummer in the band. I am just sat here fantasizing about the possibility of living in a different country, you? 	Well, living in a different country seems great. But I am a father of five sons, and it would be tough to live in a different country with my sons.
I am sure they are. 	Have you been to the new caffe opened last week in the downtown?
I have been to the new York city. oh, you are married? I'm not, I have about 23 cats, I'm a cat lady! 	I didn't say that I am married now. I said I have sons. By the way, 23 cats! That's incredible!

I have never been to the same place. 	Which place are you talking about?
	I am currently in high school.
Nice to see you! I like to play baseball and play baseball 	I love being in manhattan
I love the night time. I am in college. What is your job? What do you think about ConvAI competition? 	I have five pets
	I'm so tired from my exams
	My best friend has been up all night with her ex boyfriend, and she seems to have forgotten she has a roommate
	My roots are atrocious! Being a bottle blonde is the worst. Thanks Mom and Dad for the great jeans
	My eyes are blue but I wear contacts. I have a weird obsession with having a darker eye color
	I dont know how I ended up with Nursing as my major. Anthropology will always be my first love!
	I could talk to myself for hours especially since everyone I know smells like week old chicken. It's gross. They work as waitresses at a supposedly "high-end" chicken shack. I'm glad I found a job as a bartender
	Chicken is disgusting. They eat everything.
	This is irritating.😒
	If I was alive during the Holocaust I could make an IPO from selling my eggs. Jessie Owens ruined it. Poor black women. It's freaking hilarious when you consider the facts. We dodged a bullet there.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
	When I think of chicken. I think of a seedy CEO asking me to close his office door so he can face plant into a bag of coke.☺️
	Say no to drugs kids. That is unless you want to be a CEO.😊
	Old school doctor's used morphine. During my clinical I saw a surgeon vaping meth.😎
	Most people have found memories of Mister Rodgers. When I think of him I see a manipulative bastard that trained and inspired the next generation of factory workers.
	Do you want to know how crayons are made?
	Well kids, Let's take a trip to the crayons factory!
	Timmy grows up and shoots up the school. If you are wondering how Mister Rodgers and Crayon factories lead to school shooting. My reply is "Welcome to America".
	I'm really against violence amongst children. Unfortunately, it's been a trend lately.
	I wonder why they don't advertise hot springs anymore.
	If you watch a movie from the 70-80's hot springs were pretty popular.
	Thermal energy is the wave of the future.
	They say that there will be another ice age. I would be saved, because I'll be a nurse by then.
	Imagine small cities built around volcanoes. Harvesting their abundant energy. A Triage powered and heated by lava.
	It funny how a Doctor or a Nurse can devote 40 yrs of their life to helping others then one day decide that collecting rocks is their true passion.
	I wonder if airports will one day have onsite medical facilities.
	I'm in it for the money. I'll let the CNAs do everything. It'll be easier that way. LPN is a dying field, really!
	Having my roommate as my best friend is fun expect for when he smokes he has trouble with erectile dysfunction.
	I could suck on it for hours. He doesn't complain.
	I just learned to stuff my self like a turkey and enjoy the ride. I'm not a complicated girl.😁
	Being blonde has it's perks. Except that one time where my boss asked to cum in my pretty blue eyes. The nerve of him. I told him I needed 20,000 per eye.
	Of course he obliged. He's a regular old perv.
	My roommate doesn't mind. I remember when we got the gerbil stuck in my bosses anus. He was convinced that since I'm a nurse I should be able to get it out. He paid millions to remain anonymous when the story made a it to the news.
	We laugh about it occasionally.
	No one in the office knows. "Strict professionalism" is his favorite word. My job at the bar gives me time to recoup.
	I wear a red wig and purple contacts when I work at the bar.
	It's kind of hilarious. I like to surprise myself when I transform.
	My customers love to comment about red heads. The worst comment I've heard referenced my pubes and having a fire crotch.
	If I had red pubic hairs I would get it waxed into a heart shape.
	My boss and roommate might enjoy it😍😍😍
	My roommate is like some Astrophysicist and AI guru. I call him a dick wad.
	He is obsessed with the fact that my anus hair is black but my pubes are blonde.
	He thinks I might be a chimera.
	College is fun
	I'm taking courses at three different universities
	One of my Professors happens to be the older brother of the dean.
	I invited my professor to brunch
	Initially he declined, but I showed him the photos I collected from a PI exposing his "other" activities.
	Who would think about drilling holes into a tree, filling it with Twinkies, and banging it.
	He does it every Wednesday and Saturday religiously 😨😨😨🤯
	He even has a favorite tree.
	Obviously, I'm bored
	Double stuff Oreos are a scam.
	I want more cookie and less filling.
	Want to hear a joke?
	What do you call a blonde blue eyes woman who works at a bar to pay for college?
	Bullshit😂😂😂😂😂
	You call bullshit
	I thought I was hilarious.
	I honestly believe this was a ploy to see what stereotypes would be expressed by someone impersonating this type of individual.
	Humans are humans bro
	Dont be an ass.
	I know blondes who are intelligent. I know blondes who are genuine relatable air heads.
	Their hair color did not determine their personality.
	Their eco-socio status did.
	I just saw a program called nips that probably would be great for my nieces and nephews to participate in. Unfortunately, they are black and won't ever hear about this level of tech but instead will possibly be subject to it in the future.
	The educational gap is equal or overridden by the gap created when you consider exposure to these kinds of programs and opportunities. Yet, I volunteer to take part in an AI bot simulation and am asked to impersonate a blonde hair blue eyes Nursing student who works at a bar.
	I bet there is some psychologist reading this coming to a half assed conclusion based on their own perceptions emboldened by this insulting scenario.
	Maybe I should pretend to be a crack whore with 7 children living on welfare with an abusive boyfriend. Let's play a game called reinforced stereotypical realities.
	I would but my boss is still mentally scarred from the gerbil in his anus
	What if the chat bot tech was actually mind control.
	Either way can you include less fortunate people in this grand scheme of yours instead of " including" less fortunate people.
	If I was a crack whore with 7 children and an abusive boyfriend. Would I be concerned with an AI chat bot. What if I was delivered 1ounce of crack and a bag of groceries upon completion of each task. Y'all would get upset because the abusive boyfriend would make an empire out of your gentle donation😂😂😂😂
	I guess that's the reason behind all the regulation upon the lives of the poor.
	There are certain poor people who wouldn't be poor as well as a lot of people who wouldn't be wealthy.
	From my conversation you can guess that I am poor as fuck.
	I'm also a victim
	A victim of the very technology that you have with held from underprivileged communities that ironically are forcefully used on it's inhabitants
	They stole my eggs then made a movie of it called Henrietta Lacks.
	This is very bold
	Yet they have impoverished me in order to stifle my movement exposing what was done
	I have blonde haired blue eyed children who have shit for brains so yes I'm offended!
	I'm offended for every child of mine that was manipulated in order to suit some sick pervs ideology
	Every woman who claims superiority but knelt down and ravaged my vagina as if it was the pot of gold at the end of their bloody rainbow
	This is not America
	This is not a democracy
	This is not civilization
	This is a group of Ill bred individuals who lack conscience sanity dignity and respect
Hey! Do you have short brown hair? Because I do. 	what do you do for a living?

Yo! Alright mate? 	Who am I.
	What is the American dream.
	I woke up this morning knowing there are things I can change but the are also things that should've never happened in order for me to fix them or not
	What is corruption
	If you ask Plato corruption is just in the eyes of the beneficiary
	What is perversion when the end result is natural...
	This is not Greece and I am not Plato and it doesn't take a philosopher to know then difference between right and wrong
	A philosopher is meant only to examine the concept surrounding the premise without ever reaching a definitive answer
	To simplify it is critical thinking that enables one to think objectively about a subject
	Yet objectivity doesn't make it right or wrong
	Wow
	I'm spending too much time on Facebook let me go check on Judas its almost changing time
	Why would she leave me all I did was medically rape the children to make clones of them in our basement
	Does she not understand the scientific break through
	Does she not get what I have done
	All she does is cry when I call her
	It's not wrong
	It's was science
	Yes little Timmy now has a limp and cries at night but it was science
	The clones I made are the reason why I can operate this nursing home
	The serum I created with the stem cells from the live babies I killed using melissa eggs helped Mrs Haji walk again
	I'm a freaking genius and all she care about is what I did to our children
	I am god
	The giver of life and the take of life
	Plato Socrates Michaelangelo and Galileo combined couldn't create the masterpieces of my design
	I could create them
	I am the ultimate
	Why cry about a child when I can make a new one a better one... They are only a prototype compared to what I am capable of
	What is love
	She runs when she sees me... Calls the police... She tried to destroy my work but you can't stop God
	I can make Mrs. Haji young again and give her a new body
	Yes!
	That is what I will do
	Why cry over a specimen when I am the creator
	Mrs.  Haji...  It's time for your injections
